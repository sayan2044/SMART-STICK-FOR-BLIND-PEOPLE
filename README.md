# SMART-STICK-FOR-BLIND-PEOPLE
This is an IoT project which uses ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in front of it. This acts as a smart stick which can be used by blind people to walk with ease without getting hurt by something in front of them.  Also this is the base project upon which we developed our new idea Digital Eyes which is a better version of the smart stick.Digital Eyes would be equipped with GPS Module along with the other sensors and it would not only detect the object in front of it but also provide the shortest path with the least number of obstacles.
